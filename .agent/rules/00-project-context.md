# Project Context

This repository is the Agent Skill Framework for building and maintaining AI skills.

## Mandatory Reading
- Read `architect.md` before any task.
- Treat `architect.md` as the single source of truth for architecture, workflow, and zones.

## Scope
- Work only on skill assets and related documentation inside valid zones.
- Do not implement unrelated product features or change project scope without approval.
- Each skill must be self-contained. If it needs references, use internet sources or files inside the skill directory. Copy required information into the skill folder instead of hard-linking to project-level files.

## Success Criteria
- Output aligns with `architect.md`.
- Workflow phases and verify checkpoints are respected.
