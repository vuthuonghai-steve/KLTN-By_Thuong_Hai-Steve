# Architecture Alignment

## Valid Zones
- `SKILL.md`
- `knowledge/`
- `scripts/`
- `templates/`
- `data/`
- `loop/`
- `assets/`

## Rules
- Create new files only inside valid zones.
- If you must create anything outside these zones, stop and ask the user for explicit confirmation.
- Keep structure and naming consistent with `architect.md`.
- When in doubt, re-check `architect.md` before proceeding.
- Ensure each skill is an independent module. Reference only internet sources or files within the skill folder.
- If a skill needs project-level knowledge, copy the required content into the skill (e.g., `knowledge/`, `data/`, `templates/`) and reference it locally.
