# Workflow Discipline

Follow the 5-step workflow from `architect.md`.

## Phases
- Research → Design → Build → Verify → Maintenance

## Rules
- Complete each phase before moving to the next.
- End every phase with its verify checkpoint from the loop/verify system.
- If verify fails, report the failure, rollback to the failing phase, fix, then re-verify.
- Use Phase Mode for complex tasks and Simple Mode for simple tasks, as described in `architect.md`.
